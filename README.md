# teaching-examples

I used these code samples when teaching A level computer science.

I have many more and worksheets to go with some of these - please get in touch if you would like to use: jasonwelch@email.com

List of programs / uses:
- debug-hexconv is an exercise in debugging with students to use the techniques taught
- pong / pong-oop - comparison of a simple game written procedurally and using OO
- oxo and hangman - simple games used to teach stepwise refinement
- animalgame and graph - simple games used to teach binary tree and graph data structure
- looptiming - to demonstrate profiling and to profile different 'foreach' loop constructs in Python
- multi-merge - multithreaded merge sort - used to compare with other sort algorithms, divide and conquer, parallisable algorithms

Please ask - happy to help!
